{"name":"Caserel","tagline":"Computer-aided Segmentation of Retinal Layers in Optical Coherence Tomography Images","body":"# Welcome!\r\nThis is the main page of project Caserel, an open-source software suite for computer-aided segmentation of retinal layers in optical coherence tomography images written in Matlab.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the software supports segmentation of 6 retinal layers by automatically delineating 7 boundaries (ILM, NFL/GCL, IPL/INL, INL/OPL, OPL/ONL, IS/OS,RPE). An image browser/editor is provided for manual and semi-automated correction of the segmented retinal boundaries.  For a quick demonstration, please run script 'getRetinalLayersExample.m'.\r\n\r\n# Example Results\r\n![An example image demonstrating the segmentation results by Caserel.](https://sites.google.com/site/pangyuteng/projects/091313__yux005.jpg)\r\nAbove image illustrates the segmentation results by Caserel.  [Click here](http://www.youtube.com/embed/UWW0Y52PskA) to see more segmentation results by Caserel.\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nPlease note that this project is \"work-in-progress\", meaning many features still needs to be implemented, e.g. detection of macula and vessels.  In addition, the accuracy of the automated segmentation are not yet validated, so if you are to use the resulting segmentation for quantification of retinal layer thickness, I recommend carefully reviewing the segmentation results using either the provided GUI or other image segmentation tools.\r\n\r\n# How to pronounce Caserel? \r\nSay it like casserole.  The name is derived from \"Computer-Aided SEgmentation of REtinal Layers in optical coherence tomography images\".\r\n","google":"UA-10205645-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
