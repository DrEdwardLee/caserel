{"name":"Caserel","tagline":"Computer-aided Segmentation of Retinal Layers in Optical Coherence Tomography Images","body":"# Welcome!\r\nThis is the main page of project Caserel, an open-source software suite for computer-aided segmentation of retinal layers in optical coherence tomography images written in Matlab.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the software supports segmentation of 6 retinal layers by automatically delineating 7 boundaries (ILM, NFL/GCL, IPL/INL, INL/OPL, OPL/ONL, IS/OS,RPE). An image browser/editor is provided for manual and semi-automated correction of the segmented retinal boundaries.  For a quick demonstration, please run script 'getRetinalLayersExample.m'.\r\n\r\n# Example Results\r\n[![An example image demonstrating the segmentation results by Caserel.](https://sites.google.com/site/pangyuteng/projects/091313__yux005.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/embed/UWW0Y52PskA)\r\nAbove video illustrates the segmentation results by Caserel.\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nPlease note that this project is \"work-in-progress\", meaning many features still needs to be implemented, e.g. detection of macula and vessels.  In addition, the accuracy of the automated segmentation is not completely evaluated ([results of latest evaluation](https://github.com/pangyuteng/caserel/wiki/Evaluation-of-segmentation)), so if you are to use the resulting segmentation for quantification of retinal layer thickness, I recommend carefully reviewing the segmentation results using either the provided GUI or other image segmentation tools.\r\n\r\n# How to pronounce Caserel? \r\nSay it like casserole.
