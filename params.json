{"name":"Caserel","tagline":"Computer-aided Segmentation of Retinal Layers in Optical Coherence Tomography Images","body":"# Welcome!\r\nThis is the main page of project Caserel, an open-source software suite for computer-aided segmentation of retinal layers in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images written in Matlab.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the software supports segmentation of 6 retinal layers by automatically delineating 7 boundaries (ILM, NFL/GCL, IPL/INL, INL/OPL, OPL/ONL, IS/OS,RPE) from OCT images. An image browser/editor is provided for manual and semi-automated correction of the segmented retinal boundaries.  For a quick demonstration, please run script 'getRetinalLayersExample.m'.\r\n\r\n# Example Results\r\n[![An example image demonstrating the segmentation results by Caserel.](https://sites.google.com/site/pangyuteng/projects/091313__yux005.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/embed/UWW0Y52PskA)\r\nAbove video illustrates the segmentation results by Caserel.\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nPlease note that this project is \"[work-in-progress](https://github.com/pangyuteng/caserel/wiki/Progress)\", meaning many features still needs to be implemented, e.g. detection of macula and vessels .  In addition, the accuracy of the automated segmentation is [not completely evaluated](https://github.com/pangyuteng/caserel/wiki/Evaluation-of-segmentation), so if you are to use the resulting segmentation for quantification of retinal layer thickness, I recommend carefully reviewing the segmentation results using either the provided GUI or other image segmentation tools.\r\n\r\n# Citing Caserel\r\nThe references you will need to cite if you do use Caserel are:\r\n+ PY Teng, Caserel, GitHub repository, 2014, http://pangyuteng.github.io/caserel\r\n+ Chiu SJ et al, Automatic segmentation of seven retinal layers in SDOCT \r\nimages congruent with expert manual segmentation, Optics Express, 2010;18(18);19413-19428 \r\n\r\n# How to pronounce Caserel? \r\nSay it like casserole.
