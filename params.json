{"name":"Caserel","tagline":"Computer-aided Segmentation of Retinal Layers in Optical Coherence Tomography Images","body":"The aim of this project, Caserel`, is to build an open-source software suite for computer-aided segmentation of retinal layers in optical coherence tomography images.\r\n\r\nThis project is at its [pre-alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha) stage. Currently, the software supports segmentation of 6 retinal layers by automatically delineating 7 boundaries (ILM, NFL/GCL, IPL/INL, INL/OPL, OPL/ONL, IS/OS,RPE). An image browser/editor is provided for manual or semi-automated correction of the segmented retinal boundaries. The segmentation algorithms used are based on graph-theory and is written in Matlab. You will need Matlab to execute this software.  Run script 'getRetinalLayersExample.m' for a quick demonstration.\r\n\r\n![An example image demonstrating the segmentation results by Caserel.](https://sites.google.com/site/pangyuteng/projects/091313__yux005.jpg)\r\nAn example image demonstrating the segmentation results by Caserel.\r\n\r\n` How to pronounce CASeReL? say it like casserole.  The name is derived from \"Computer-Aided SEgmentation of REtinal Layers in optical coherence tomography images\".","google":"UA-10205645-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
