{"name":"Caserel","tagline":"Computer-aided segmentation of retinal layers in optical coherence tomography images","body":"The aim of this project, caserel`, is to build an open-source software suite for computer-aided segmentation of retinal layers in optical coherence tomography images.\r\n\r\nThis project is at its infancy stage. Currently, the software supports segmentation of 6 retinal layers by automatically delineating 7 boundaries (ILM, NFL/GCL, IPL/INL, INL/OPL, OPL/ONL, IS/OS,RPE). An image browser/editor is provided for manual or semi-automated correction of the segmented retinal boundaries. The segmentation algorithms used are based on graph-theory and is written in Matlab. You will need Matlab to execute this software.\r\n\r\nFor a demonstration, run script 'getRetinalLayersExample.m'.\r\n\r\n` How to pronounce CASeReL? say it like casserole.  The name is derived from \"Computer-Aided SEgmentation of REtinal Layers in optical coherence tomography images\".\r\n","google":"UA-10205645-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
